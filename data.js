We embraced the challenges of working with native applications, augmented reality, and multiplayer socket functionality. In the end, we created a project with a separately hosted back-end database that showcases the different experiences AR can provide. We also built out additional functionality that makes it easy to switch go.bARk's surface recognition to being a tabletop game using Pixi.js's raytracing capabilities.",

Since then, I have read so many webtoons of all different genres and art styles. I'm particularly impressed by stories that have nuanced characters, stories that utilize different features on your phone, and stories where the characters either break the fourth wall or have no interest in the current plotline. Refreshing! \nSome titles: \n\t\tGourmet Hound, The Duchess's 50 Tea Recipes, Horang's Nightmare, Ghost Teller, I Don't Want This Kind of Hero, Tales of the Unusual, Odd Girl Out, Eleceed, Beware the Villainess, I Want to be You for a Day,  etc... etc... etc...",

The genres I have been reading most recently include isekais, reincarnation, intrigue, and revenge. One novel I enjoyed was The Villainess Turns the Hourglass, which was particular satisfying for its characterization. The main character is neither omniscient nor omnipotent, but has the cleverness to adjust her choices and take control of her fate. The dearth of unnecessary romance was also a huge plus.',
